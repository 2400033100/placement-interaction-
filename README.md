A modern, minimalist Full-Stack Application Development (FSAD) prototype designed to streamline the university placement and recruitment lifecycle. 

CampusLink bridges the gap between top university talent and employers by providing a unified platform with role-specific dashboards, robust application tracking, and real-time placement analytics.

## ✨ Key Features & Dashboards

The system is engineered with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in mind, featuring four distinct user experiences:

* **👨‍🎓 Student Portal:** Allows students to discover open job opportunities, filter roles by type/tags, apply with a single click, and track the status of their ongoing applications.
* **🏢 Employer Portal:** Enables companies to post new job listings, review incoming student applications, and manage the candidate pipeline (e.g., Reject or Schedule Interview).
* **📊 Placement Officer Dashboard:** A high-level analytics view tracking total active jobs, overall application volume, placement rates, and a live system activity log.
* **⚙️ Administrator Panel:** Master control for system configurations, database management, and user role adjustments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend Library:** React.js
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Utility-first approach for the minimalist pastel UI)
* **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState` for mock data handling)
* **Prototyping:** CodeSandbox / Vite
